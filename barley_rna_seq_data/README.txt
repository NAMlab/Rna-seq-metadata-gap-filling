Normalized metadata file
in this file i have standardized some crucial columns such as tissue,treatment,developmental stage by manually in excel.

for eaxample ,if it is named as (in metadata)..
flag leaf,primary leaf,secondary leaf,leaf1,leaf2 = leaf
embryo,endosperm,germinating seed,kernel,pericarp and hulls = seed/grain
lemma,lodicule,palea,rachis,pistil,pollen,glume,inflorescence = spike
root cap,root tip,root apical meristem,root tip,root meristem = root
apex,coleoptile,crown,shoot meristem,shoot apex,vegetative apex = shoot
above ground parts ,aerial,callus,meristem,plant tissue,elongation zone = mixed
like this i have categorized them for tisuue 

for treatment
water logged,aluminium stress,low-p stress,nitrogen stress = abiotic stress
chitosan treated/biological replicate ,elice16indures = biostimulant
high temperature,heat stress = heat
low temperature = cold
gene silencing = genetic modififaction
micorrhizal,fungal,inoculation,bacterium = pathogen
salt treatnent,nacl treatment = salt
without water , drought stress = drought
control,mock,no tretment, normal,solvent control =control
like this i have did for treatment

for developmental stages
germinating seed,germinating embryo,germinating stage = germination
1,24,32 days after pollination,8 days after flowering ,anthesis,booting stage,early milk stage,filling stage,flowering stage,heading stage,mature,pre flowering, waddington stage = reproductive
double ridge = transition
tillering,seedling stage,axillary shoot stage,leaf producton, = vegetative
